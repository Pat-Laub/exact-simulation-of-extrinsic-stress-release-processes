# Code supplement for the paper 'Exact simulation of extrinsic stress-release processes'

Please see the Jupyter notebooks for the main use of the code to generate the figures found in the paper.
The main algorithms are implemented in `simulate.py` and `inverse_moments.py`.
For further questions, feel free to email me (Pat Laub), I'll be happy to discuss anything related to this codebase.
